## Laravel 5 Skeleton App

This is the skeleton app I use when starting a new project in Laravel 5. The default Laravel skeleton app is OK, but
I found myself repeating the same hour's worth of effort each time I used it as the base for a new app, so I decided to
create this skeleton app instead to save myself that time in the future.

To create this skeleton app I did the following:

1. Created a new laravel application using `laravel new l5skel`

2. Ran `php artisan fresh` to remove much of the scaffolding that I didn't want.
 
3. Removed all of the stuff related to `gulp` and `less` etc, as I tend to add back only what I need as I create a new
project.

4. Added the controversial `Models` folder under `App`. In most cases this is where I keep my models, but it is easy
enough to remove as the application morphs into a more complex structure.

5. Moved the `Views` folder from `resources` to `App`, because, well, I prefer it there. :-)

6. Added the `spatie/laravel-tail` package to restore `php artisan tail` functionality.

7. Added the `illuminate/html` package to restore the Laravel Forms and HTML helper functionality that I so loved in
Laravel 4.

8. Changed the `App\Exceptions\Handler` class to log exceptions using `Illuminate\Log` rather than calling the
`parent::report()` method, which calls `Monolog\Logger` directly. I did this because of the next change...

9. Added some code to listen for all `Log` events so that I can email the serious errors to myself.

10. Added a basic Bootstrap CSS layout for quickly mocking up new sites, which  includes jQuery and the standard
Internet Explorer fixes. This may seem trivial, but it has taken a lot of effort to figure out what files can be loaded
from CDNs and what files need to be loaded locally in order for all of this stuff to work correctly.

I have also added a `Generic` exception class and a `QuickMail` helper class, which simplifies the task of sending
emails to myself when serious errors occur.

### Using this package

If you're using this package as the start of a new project, the easist thing to do is probably download the zip file,
unpack that, change into the newly created project folder and then run `composer install` to download the dependencies.
Don't forget to rename .env.example to .env and fill in the blanks! Also, if you're running on a Mac or Linux environment,
you will need to set the permissions on the storage folder so that the web server has write access to it. In a development
environment, chmod -R 777 storage should be fine, but I would recommend taking a more thoughtful approach in a production
environment.
